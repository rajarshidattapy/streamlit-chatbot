## Features

- **Unified Interface**: Interact with multiple AI models through a single chatbot interface.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extend the repository by adding new models or updating existing ones.
- **Support for Multiple Platforms**: Deploy the chatbots on various platforms like web, mobile, or standalone desktop applications.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Leverage pre-trained models from popular frameworks.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wrapper-chatbots-with-ai-models.git
cd wrapper-chatbots-with-ai-models
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Set up API Keys**: If you're using any external services (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Claude), make sure to set your API keys in the environment variables or the `.env` file.

2. **Run the Chatbot**: Launch the chatbot with the desired model:

```bash
python chatbot.py --model [MODEL_NAME]
```

3. **Interact with the Chatbot**: Open the specified interface (web, terminal, etc.) and start interacting with the AI models.

## Available AI Models

This repository supports the following AI models:

### 1. NLP Models

- **Gemini**: For various natural language processing tasks.
- **OpenAI GPT**: For generating human-like text responses.
- **Claude**: For advanced conversational AI.
- **And more to come...**

## Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the chatbots with different models:

### Example 1: NLP Chatbot with OpenAI GPT

```bash
python chatbot.py --model openai_gpt
```

Interact with the chatbot:

```text
User: Write a short story about a robot.
Chatbot: Once upon a time, in a world not so different from our own...
```

### Example 2: NLP Chatbot with Gemini

```bash
python chatbot.py --model gemini
```

Interact with the chatbot:

```text
User: Summarize the latest news.
Chatbot: Here’s a brief summary of today’s top stories...
```
